# Academic Page GWW

This repository hosts an academic webpage and a sample Vue application.

## Vue App

The Vue application lives under `vue-app/` and was scaffolded using the Vite Vue template. Inside that directory you can run the following commands:

```bash
npm run dev    # start development server
npm run build  # build for production
```

The project requires dependencies installed via `npm install` before running these commands.
