      I am an associate professor at Beijing University of Chemical Technology.
      My research focuses on graph convolutional neural networks, multi-source
      heterogeneous data mining, and the analysis of network robustness by
      integrating representation learning with reinforcement learning. My
      relevant works have been published in journals such as Nature
      Communications, Social Networks, and Journal of Social Computing. I have
      also presided over one Postdoctoral Science Foundation General Project and
      currently serve as an editor for the Journal of Social Computing.
