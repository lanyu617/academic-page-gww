                      The study of interlayer similarity of multiplex networks
                      helps us understand the intrinsic structure of complex
                      systems, revealing how changes in one layer can propagate
                      and affect others, thus enabling broad implications for
                      transportation, social, and biological systems. Existing
                      algorithms that measure similarities between network
                      layers typically encode only partial information, which
                      limits their effectiveness in capturing the full
                      complexity inherent in multiplex networks. To address this
                      limitation, we propose an interlayer similarity measuring
                      approach named Embedding Aided Interlayer Similarity
                      (EATSim). EATSim concurrently incorporates intralayer
                      structural similarity and cross-layer anchor node
                      alignment consistency, providing a more comprehensive
                      framework for analyzing interconnected systems. Extensive
                      experiments on both synthetic and real-world networks
                      demonstrate that EATSim effectively captures the
                      underlying geometric similarities between interconnected
                      networks, significantly improving the accuracy of
                      interlayer similarity measurement. Moreover, EATSim
                      achieves state-of-the-art performance in two downstream
                      applications: predicting network robustness and network
                      reducibility, showing its great potential in enhancing the
                      understanding and management of complex systems.

                      Identifying the minimal set of nodes whose removal breaks
                      a complex network apart, also referred as the network
                      dismantling problem, is a highly non-trivial task with
                      applications in multiple domains. Whereas network
                      dismantling has been extensively studied over the past
                      decade, research has primarily focused on the optimization
                      problem for single-layer networks, neglecting that many,
                      if not all, real networks display multiple layers of
                      interdependent interactions. In such networks, the
                      optimization problem is fundamentally different as the
                      effect of removing nodes propagates within and across
                      layers in a way that can not be predicted using a
                      single-layer perspective. Here, we propose a dismantling
                      algorithm named MultiDismantler, which leverages multiplex
                      network representation and deep reinforcement learning to
                      optimally dismantle multi-layer interdependent networks.
                      MultiDismantler is trained on small synthetic graphs; when
                      applied to large, either real or synthetic networks, it
                      displays exceptional dismantling performance, clearly
                      outperforming all existing benchmark algorithms. We show
                      that MultiDismantler is effective in guiding strategies
                      for the containment of diseases in social networks
                      characterized by multiple layers of social interactions.
                      Also, we show that MultiDismantler is useful in the design
                      of protocols aimed at delaying the onset of cascading
                      failures in interdependent critical infrastructures.

                      Weak ties that bridge different communities are crucial
                      for preserving global connectivity, enhancing resilience,
                      and maintaining functionality and dynamics of complex
                      networks, However, making accurate link predictions for
                      weak ties remain challenging due to lacking of common
                      neighbors. Most complex systems, such as transportation
                      and social networks, comprise multiple types of
                      interactions, which can be modeled by multiplex networks
                      with each layer representing a different type of
                      connection. Better utilizing information from other layers
                      can mitigate the lack of information for predicting weak
                      ties. Here, we propose a GNN-based representation learning
                      framework for Multiplex Weak Tie Prediction (MWTP). It
                      leverages both an intra-layer and an inter-layer
                      aggregator to effectively learn and fuse information
                      across different layers. The intra-layer one integrates
                      features from multi-order neighbors, and the inter-layer
                      aggregation exploits either logit regression or a more
                      sophisticated semantic voting mechanism to compute
                      nodal-level inter-layer attentions, leading to two
                      variants of our framework, MWTP-logit, and MWTP-semantic.
                      The former one is more efficient in implementation
                      attribute to fewer parameters, while the latter one is
                      slower but has stronger learning capabilities. Extensive
                      experiments demonstrate that our MWTPs outperform eleven
                      popular baselines for predicting both weak ties and all
                      ties across diverse real-world multiplex networks.
                      Additionally, MWTPs achieve good prediction performance
                      with a relatively small training size.

                      High-throughput computational screening (HTCS) methods
                      have been widely used in addressing the challenges of
                      screening metal-organic framework (MOF) materials with
                      high performance from large datasets. Accurately
                      predicting the performance of MOFs with hypothetical
                      structures, such as adsorption capacity for methane, can
                      be a great help to HTCS. Traditional molecular dynamics
                      simulation methods are computationally cumbersome and
                      costly. Feature engineering-based machine learning methods
                      have a high reliance on expert experience to extract
                      effective features, some of which can be time-consuming to
                      calculate. Although some classical machine learning models
                      can already achieve good performance, the heavy burden for
                      features computation prior to model training would
                      eventually limit their practical applications, flexibility
                      and generality. In this paper, an approach is proposed for
                      predicting the methane adsorption ability of MOFs directly
                      from their crystal structural information recorded in
                      Crystallographic Information File (CIF)-formatted files,
                      without the need for molecular dynamics simulation or
                      calculating any physical or chemical properties. By
                      expressing the structural information in the crystal cells
                      of MOFs as matrices, a deep convolutional neural network
                      model based on residual structure is applied to train an
                      end-to-end model to predict their methane adsorption
                      ability. The experimental results show that the model
                      accomplishes the prediction task with high accuracy,
                      giving the mean square correlation coefficient (R2) as
                      0.925 and the mean absolute error (MAE) as 22.28 cm3g-1,
                      which demonstrates a good performance over baselines.

                      BG within a healthy range through extracorporeal insulin
                      injections is an important task for people with type 1
                      diabetes. However,traditional patient self-management is
                      cumbersome and risky. Recent research has been devoted to
                      exploring individualized and automated BG control
                      approaches, among which Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)
                      shows potential as an emerging approach. In this paper, we
                      use an exponential decay model of drug concentration to
                      convert the formalization of the BG control problem, which
                      takes into account the delay and prolongedness of drug
                      effects, from a PAE-POMDP (Prolonged Action
                      Effect-Partially Observable Markov Decision Process) to a
                      MDP, and we propose a novel multi-step DRL-based algorithm
                      to solve the problem. The Prioritized Experience Replay
                      (PER) sampling method is also used in it. Compared to
                      single-step bootstrapped updates, multi-step learning is
                      more efficient and reduces the influence from biasing
                      targets. Our proposed method converges faster and achieves
                      higher cumulative rewards compared to the benchmark in the
                      same training environment, and improves the time-in-range
                      (TIR), the percentage of time the patient's BG is within
                      the target range, in the evaluation phase. Our work
                      validates the effectiveness of multi-step reinforcement
                      learning in BG control, which may help to explore the
                      optimal glycemic control measure and improve the survival
                      of diabetic patients.

                      known as the link prediction task. Recent network
                      embedding based link prediction algorithms have
                      demonstrated ground-breaking performance on link
                      prediction accuracy. Those algorithms usually apply node
                      attributes as the initial feature input to accelerate the
                      convergence speed during the training process. However,
                      they do not take full advantage of node feature
                      information. In this paper, besides applying feature
                      attributes as the initial input, we make better
                      utilization of node attribute information by building
                      attributable networks and plugging attributable networks
                      into some typical link prediction algorithms and name this
                      algorithm Attributive Graph Enhanced Embedding (AGEE).
                      AGEE is able to automatically learn the weighting
                      trades-off between the structure and the attributive
                      networks. Numerical experiments show that AGEE can improve
                      the link prediction accuracy by around 3% compared with
                      SEAL, Variational Graph AutoEncoder (VGAE), and node2vec.

                      Multiple-source single-cell datasets have accumulated
                      quickly and need computational methods to integrate and
                      decompose into meaningful components. Here, we present
                      inClust (integrated clustering), a flexible deep
                      generative framework that enables embedding auxiliary
                      information, latent space vector arithmetic, and
                      clustering. All functional parts are relatively modular,
                      independent in implementation but interrelated at runtime,
                      resulting in an all-in general framework that could work
                      in supervised, semi-supervised, or unsupervised mode. We
                      show that inClust is superior to most data integration
                      methods in benchmark datasets. Then, we demonstrate the
                      capability of inClust in the tasks of conditional
                      out-of-distribution generation in supervised mode, label
                      transfer in semi-supervised mode, and spatial domain
                      identification in unsupervised mode. In these examples,
                      inClust could accurately express the effect of each
                      covariate, distinguish the query-specific cell types, or
                      segment spatial domains. The results support that inClust
                      is an excellent general framework for multiple-task
                      harmonization and data decomposition.

                      Networks are powerful tools for representing the
                      relationships and interactions between entities in various
                      disciplines. However, existing network analysis tools and
                      packages either lack powerful functionality or are not
                      scalable for large networks. In this descriptor, we
                      present EasyGraph, an open-source network analysis library
                      that supports several network data formats and powerful
                      network mining algorithms. EasyGraph provides excellent
                      operating efficiency through a hybrid Python/C++
                      implementation and multiprocessing optimization. It is
                      applicable to various disciplines and can handle
                      large-scale networks. We demonstrate the effectiveness and
                      efficiency of EasyGraph by applying crucial metrics and
                      algorithms to random and real-world networks in domains
                      such as physics, chemistry, and biology. The results
                      demonstrate that EasyGraph improves the network analysis
                      efficiency for users and reduces the difficulty of
                      conducting large-scale network analysis. Overall, it is a
                      comprehensive and efficient open-source tool for
                      interdisciplinary network analysis.

                      Venture capital (VC) is a form of private equity financing
                      provided by VC institutions to startups with high growth
                      potential due to innovative technology or novel business
                      models but also high risks. To against uncertainties and
                      benefit from mutual complementarity and sharing resources
                      and information, making joint-investments with other VC
                      institutions on the same startup are pervasive, which
                      forms an ever-growing complex syndication network.
                      Attaining objective classifications of VC institutions and
                      revealing the latent structure of joint-investment
                      behaviors between them can deepen our understanding of the
                      VC industry and boost the healthy development of the
                      market and economy. In this work, we devise an iterative
                      Loubar method based on the Lorenz curve to make objective
                      classification of VC institutions automatically, which
                      does not require setting arbitrary thresholds and the
                      number of categories. We further reveal distinct
                      investment behaviors across categories, where the
                      top-ranked group enters more industries and investment
                      stages with a better performance. Through network
                      embedding of joint investment relations, we unveil the
                      existence of possible territories of top-ranked VC
                      institutions, and the hidden structure of relations
                      between VC institutions.

                      Network embedding is a general-purpose machine learning
                      technique that encodes network structure in vector spaces
                      with tunable dimension. Choosing an appropriate embedding
                      dimension – small enough to be efficient and large enough
                      to be effective – is challenging but necessary to generate
                      embeddings applicable to a multitude of tasks. Existing
                      strategies for the selection of the embedding dimension
                      rely on performance maximization in downstream tasks.
                      Here, we propose a principled method such that all
                      structural information of a network is parsimoniously
                      encoded. The method is validated on various embedding
                      algorithms and a large corpus of real-world networks. The
                      embedding dimension selected by our method in real-world
                      networks suggest that efficient encoding in
                      low-dimensional spaces is usually possible.

                    <p>
                      In this paper, we propose graph attention based network
                      representation (GANR) which utilizes the graph attention
                      architecture and takes graph structure as the supervised
                      learning information. Compared with node classification
                      based representations, GANR can be used to learn
                      representation for any given graph. GANR is not only
                      capable of learning high quality node representations that
                      achieve a competitive performance on link prediction,
                      network visualization and node classification but it can
                      also extract meaningful attention weights that can be
                      applied in node centrality measuring task. GANR can
                      identify the leading venture capital investors, discover
                      highly cited papers and find the most influential nodes in
                      Susceptible Infected Recovered Model. We conclude that
                      link structures in graphs are not limited on predicting
                      linkage itself, it is capable of revealing latent node
                      information in an unsupervised way once a appropriate
                      learning algorithm, like GANR, is provided.

                      Cities are centers for the integration of capital and
                      incubators of inventions. Attracting venture capital (VC)
                      is of great importance for cities to advance in innovative
                      technology and business models towards a sustainable and
                      prosperous future. Yet we still lack a quantitative
                      understanding of the relationship between urban
                      characteristics and VC activities. In this paper, we find
                      a clear nonlinear scaling relationship between VC
                      activities and the urban population of Chinese cities. In
                      such nonlinear systems, the widely applied linear per
                      capita indicators would be either biased to larger cities
                      or smaller cities depends on whether it is superlinear or
                      sublinear, while the residual of cities relative to the
                      prediction of scaling law is a more objective and
                      scale-invariant metric. Such a metric can distinguish the
                      effects of local dynamics and scaled growth induced by the
                      change of population size. The spatiotemporal evolution of
                      such metrics on VC activities reveals three distinct
                      groups of cities, two of which stand out with increasing
                      and decreasing trends, respectively. The taxonomy results
                      together with spatial analysis also signify different
                      development modes between large urban agglomeration
                      regions. Besides, we notice the evolution of scaling
                      exponents on VC activities are of much larger fluctuations
                      than on socioeconomic output of cities, and a conceptual
                      model that focuses on the growth dynamics of different
                      sized cities can well explain it, which we assume would be
                      general to other scenarios.

                      representations with a variety of node similarity
                      definitions, have a wide range of downstream applications.
                      Most existing methods either have low accuracies in
                      downstream tasks or a very limited application field, such
                      as article classification in citation networks. In this
                      paper, we propose a novel network representation method,
                      named Link Prediction based Network Representation (LPNR),
                      which generalizes the latest graph neural network and
                      optimizes a carefully designed objective function that
                      preserves linkage structures. LPNR can not only learn
                      meaningful node representations that achieve competitive
                      accuracy in node centrality measurement and community
                      detection but also achieve high accuracy in the link
                      prediction task. Experiments prove the effectiveness of
                      LPNR on three real-world networks. With the mini-batch and
                      fixed sampling strategy, LPNR can learn the embedding of
                      large graphs in a few hours.

                      by Using Big Data of Social Networks.

                      This paper poses a question: How many types of social
                      relations can be categorized in the Chinese context? In
                      social networks, the calculation of tie strength can
                      better represent the degree of intimacy of the
                      relationship between nodes, rather than just indicating
                      whether the link exists or not. Previou research suggests
                      that Granovetter measures tie strength so as to
                      distinguish strong ties from weak ties, and the Dunbar
                      circle theory may offer a plausible approach to
                      calculating 5 types of relations according to interaction
                      frequency via unsupervised learning (e.g., clustering
                      interactive data between users in Facebook and Twitter).
                      In this paper, we differentiate the layers of an
                      ego-centered network by measuring the different dimensions
                      of user's online interaction data based on the Dunbar
                      circle theory. To label the types of Chinese guanxi, we
                      conduct a survey to collect the ground truth from the real
                      world and link this survey data to big data collected from
                      a widely used social network platform in China. After
                      repeating the Dunbar experiments, we modify our computing
                      methods and indicators computed from big data in order to
                      have a model best fit for the ground truth. At the same
                      time, a comprehensive set of effective predictors are
                      selected to have a dialogue with existing theories of tie
                      strength. Eventually, by combining Guanxi theory with
                      Dunbar circle studies, four types of guanxi are found to
                      represent a four-layer model of a Chinese ego-centered
                      network.

                      This paper uses a network dynamics model to explain the
                      formation of a small-world network with an elite-clique.
                      This network is a small-world network with an elite-clique
                      at its center in which elites are also the centers of many
                      small groups. These leaders also act as bridges between
                      different small groups. Network dynamics are an important
                      research topic due to their ability to explain the
                      evolution of network structures. In this paper, a Chinese
                      Venture Capital (VC) network was coded from joint
                      investments between VC firms and then analyzed to uncover
                      its network properties and factors that influence its
                      evolution. We first built a random graph model to control
                      for factors such as network scale, network growth,
                      investment frequency and syndication tendency. Then we
                      added a partner-selection mechanism and used two theories
                      to analyze the formation of network structure: relational
                      embeddedness and structural embeddedness. After that, we
                      ran simulations and compared the three models with the
                      actual Chinese VC network. To do this we computed the
                      elite-clique’s EI index, degree distribution, clustering
                      coefficient distribution and motifs. Results show that
                      adding embeddedness theories significantly improved the
                      network dynamic model’s predictive power, and help us
                      uncover the mechanisms that affect the formation of a
                      small-world industrial network with an elite-clique at its
                      center.

                      Network embedding which encodes all vertices in a network
                      as a set of numerical vectors in accordance with it’s
                      local and global structures, has drawn widespread
                      attention. Network embedding not only learns significant
                      features of a network, such as the clustering and linking
                      prediction but also learns the latent vector
                      representation of the nodes which provides theoretical
                      support for a variety of applications, such as
                      visualization, link prediction, node classification, and
                      recommendation. As the latest progress of the research,
                      several algorithms based on random walks have been
                      devised. Although those algorithms have drawn much
                      attention for their high scores in learning efficiency and
                      accuracy, there is still a lack of theoretical
                      explanation, and the transparency of those algorithms has
                      been doubted. Here, we propose an approach based on the
                      open-flow network model to reveal the underlying flow
                      structure and its hidden metric space of different random
                      walk strategies on networks. We show that the essence of
                      embedding based on random walks is the latent metric
                      structure defined on the open-flow network. This not only
                      deepens our understanding of random- walk-based embedding
                      algorithms but also helps in finding new potential
                      applications in network embedding.

                    <p>
                      The web can be regarded as an ecosystem of digital
                      resources connected and shaped by collective successive
                      behaviors of users. Knowing how people allocate limited
                      attention on different resources is of great importance.
                      To answer this, we embed the most popular Chinese web
                      sites into a high dimensional Euclidean space based on the
                      open flow network model of a large number of Chinese
                      users’ collective attention flows, which both considers
                      the connection topology of hyperlinks between the sites
                      and the collective behaviors of the users. With these
                      tools, we rank the web sites and compare their
                      centralities based on flow distances with other metrics.
                      We also study the patterns of attention flow allocation,
                      and find that a large number of web sites concentrate on
                      the central area of the embedding space, and only a small
                      fraction of web sites disperse in the periphery. The
                      entire embedding space can be separated into 3
                      regions(core, interim, and periphery). The sites in the
                      core (1%) occupy a majority of the attention flows (40%),
                      and the sites (34%) in the interim attract 40%, whereas
                      other sites (65%) only take 20% flows. What’s more, we
                      clustered the web sites into 4 groups according to their
                      positions in the space, and found that similar web sites
                      in contents and topics are grouped together. In short, by
                      incorporating the open flow network model, we can clearly
                      see how collective attention allocates and flows on
                      different web sites, and how web sites connected each
                      other.
